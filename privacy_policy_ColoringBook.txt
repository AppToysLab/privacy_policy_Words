Child-Focused Privacy

This app is part of the Google Play "Designed for Families" program and is designed to be safe for children.

Information Collection and Use

The app may collect limited non-personal usage data (such as crash logs or performance analytics) to help us improve the app. This is done using Google Play Services or similar family-safe tools that comply with Google’s Families policy.

These tools do not collect personal identifiers and are used solely to improve the app’s performance and stability.
